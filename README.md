Implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch, which is a probabilistic classifier used for classification tasks. The algorithm works by assuming that the attributes are conditionally independent given the class label. It's a popular algorithm for text classification, spam filtering, and sentiment analysis.It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
